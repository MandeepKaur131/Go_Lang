Why Go
    Light-Weight
    Fast
        Execution Speed: Js, Pyhton, Ruby, PHP (Interpeted languages)
        Compilation Speed: Rust, C, C++, Java, C#
        Java and C# runs on VM
        GO's speed in kind of same to Java and C#
        A piece code is included in evey GO program for memory which slows the speed a lil
    Go is compiled language

Compilation: We write code in human readable format. Computer can't understand the what
humans can! Hence, CPU needs it's 1 and 0 and that's all what compilation is! The conversation
of human readable code into byte is compilation.

The program or interface which does this program is called a compiler. Programming langs like
Java and C# have their own compilers.

Interpreter:
Distributor: we gave the raw file..then the person can run Python file_name.py
The demerits:
    The person needs to have the python installed
    People can have access your code and a-ha it's open hourse now
Compilation
Disttibution: We share the compiled file - an executeable file - much easier

GO is strongly and static typed Language.

Fast = Speed and memory
Rust / C - Memory is Mannual!
Java - Garbage Collectiona and automated
It's like creating a mini JVM and run the code their
Java uses more memory

Go has automated memory management but no VM. Go code has a little more code which make memory
management efficient...yeah more code
The purpose of the GO runtime is to cleanup unused memory
%T is for printing the Type

Standard sizes that should be used unless the developer has a specfic need are:
 - int
 - unit
 - float64
 - complex128
